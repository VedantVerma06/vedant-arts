        "An artist cannot fail,<br>
        It's a success to be one!"<br><br>
        Hello! My name is Vedant Verma, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (B.Tech CSE), in my second year of study.<br><br>
        Alongside my academic journey in the field of technology, I have a deep-rooted passion for sketching. I began sketching during my 8th or 9th grade, and over the years, it has grown from a casual interest into a meaningful and creative outlet.<br><br>
        This website serves as a portfolio of my artistic work â€” a space where I showcase my sketches and explore the intersection of art and technology. Through each piece, I aim to capture emotion, detail, and imagination.<br><br>
